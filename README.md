# TO DO List - Firebase
A To Do list application built with Firebase. Create, update, and check off tasks. List is shared by all users of the application.

## How to Use the App
Use the form to add tasks. Click on link to edit. Click on check mark to marke the task complete, removing it from the list.

## Future Development Ideas
* Choose a list to view instead of only one list for all users to interact with.
* Only authorized users may view a list.
* A list can have administrator/owner/user

The list is updated in real time as all users interact with the list.
